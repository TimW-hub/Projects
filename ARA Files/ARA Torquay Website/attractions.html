    <h2>Babbacombe Attractions</h2>
    <div id="attractions-main">
        <div id="attractions-content">
        <h3>Bygones</h3>
        <p>In the village of St Marychurch close to Babbacombe, Bygones is open every day except Christmas Day, and in the summer open till 10pm in the week. Shop as our grandparents used to shop, go into a Victorian parlour,visit the illuminated Fantasy Land in miniature, see the scenic working model railway and climb into the cab of a real steam loco. Walk through a World War I trench.</p>
        
        <h3>Cockington Village and Country Park</h3>
        <p>Open through the year to Christmas Eve, and with free admission, you can see how things used to be. Ride there from the sea front in a horse and carriage. Visit the stately Manor House, stroll through the gardens, watch the village blacksmith at work, eat at the Mill Restaurant with its working water wheel, enjoy cricket matches on the village green, admire the thatched cottages. An unchanged village a mile or two from one of Britain's most popular resorts.</p>
        
        <h3>Torquay Museum</h3>
        <p>Just up the road from the harbour as you go towards Babbacombe, the Museum has six galleries including an Archaeological Gallery with exhibits including a fragment of the oldest human remains found in Britain. There's also an Agatha Christie exhibition with displays of photographs, newspaper cuttings, books and other memorabilia tracing her life and work.</p>
        
        <h3>Torre Abbey</h3>
        <p>The original Norman Abbey was destroyed by the order of Henry VIII, though some parts of the building escaped his attention. The present Abbey Mansion was built during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and is open all year. There are collections of paintings, silver and glass. In front are the Italian Gardens and a large ornamental pond, tennis courts and a putting green.</p>
